## 👋 Hi, I'm Olatunji Oluwafemi Temitope

🎓 3rd Year Computer Science Student at Babcock University  
📍 Based in Nigeria  
🌱 Currently learning Flutter, Spring Boot, and Appium  
🧑‍🏫 Passionate about teaching others Java, C, and backend development  


### 🚀 Tech Stack
- 💻 Languages: Java, PHP, Python, Dart, C, C++, C#, JavaScript
- 🧰 Frameworks: Spring Boot, Flutter, Laravel
- 📱 Mobile Dev: Flutter
- 🗃️ Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
- ☁️ Backend: Spring Boot, Laravel
- 🧪 Testing: Selenium, Appium (beginner)


### 🤓 Fun fact: ...

- 🧠 I treat bugs like side quests — annoying, but I always come out stronger.
- 🧰 I can explain Java OOP to you like it’s a Marvel origin story.
- ✍️ Currently journaling my internship like it’s a dev series on Netflix.
- 🧪 I broke Appium more times than I care to admit — but I *did* fix it.
- 🎯 My idea of fun? Debugging until 2am and then writing a blog post about it.
- 🧑‍🏫 I mentor devs because teaching is the best way to learn... and because I’m lowkey good at it.
- 🌍 I still think semicolons should come with a warning label.
- 📚 Studying CS at Babcock... but learning *everything else* from the school of YouTube + Docs.
- 📱 Flutter and I are in a love-hate relationship — but we’re working it out.
